Personal project inspired by the Pluot app on android, as I liked the concept but could not access it on pc, and wanted more worldbuilding tools and less storyboarding tools. Does something like this that's better than whay I can do exist? Almost certainly but I like doing things myself.

Written in Python, version 3.11
UI written in Kivy

Nowhere near finished. 

Major Plans:
Release for Desktop (Windows, Linux, MacOS)
Release for Mobile (Android, iOS)
Cloud storage? Data Syncing?
Expand Kivy markup to allow for (pseudo) embedded images.
Make theme customizable.
